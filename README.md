## Note    
Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any machine learning project. It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:

1. Lowercasing   
2. Removing unwanted characters   
3. Tokenizing the string   
4. Removing stop words and punctuation     
5. Stemming or Lemmatization
