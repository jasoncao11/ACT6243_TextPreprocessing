## Note    
Data preprocessing is one of the critical steps in any machine learning project. It includes cleaning and formatting the data before feeding into a machine learning algorithm. For NLP, the preprocessing steps are comprised of the following tasks:

Lowercasing   
Removing unwanted characters   
Tokenizing the string   
Removing stop words and punctuation     
Stemming or Lemmatization
